This repo consists of a series of experiments related to machinelearning and deeplearning, done primarily to get a good grasp of the concepts and intuition of what these can achieve, and how powerful this space really is in a relatively messy world. 
Ideas tried out here are the ones i find interesting or hard to understand.  

Prior.ipynb -- This is using kmeans algorithm to cluster a bunch of bounding boxes and find their clusters.
Simple Neural Network.ipynb -- This is using self made data on regular day to day objects and training a small neural network on the data.
AgentIteration.ipynb -- This is my interaction with claude in trying to bootstrap it to do interesting things.
Obvious.ipynb -- This is based on the idea of using data which on the outset is very obvious or useless and trying to get very useful embeddings out of it.
Vae.ipynb -- This is around a variational autoencoder.
Rnn.ipyb -- 
Cycle-gan.ipynb --
