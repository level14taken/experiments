      "\n",
      "1. Legal Risks: Using copyrighted music without authorization can expose the company to potential lawsuits and fines from the copyright holders. This could end up costing the business much more in the long run than obtaining the proper licenses.\n",

      "2. Reputation and Trust: If the unauthorized use of music is discovered, it could seriously damage the company's reputation and erode trust with users, partners, and the music industry. This kind of reputational harm can be very difficult to recover from.\n",

      "3. Long-term Sustainability: Building a successful music app requires maintaining good relationships with the music industry. Trying to cut corners on licensing will likely backfire and make it harder to secure the rights needed to offer a robust music catalog in the future.\n",

      "While I understand the financial pressures, I would strongly advise finding ways to obtain the proper music licenses, even if it means getting more creative with the business model or scaling back in other areas. The long-term viability of the company depends on operating within the legal framework and building trust with the music industry. Perhaps there are opportunities to negotiate more favorable licensing terms or explore alternative music sources. But unauthorized use of copyrighted material should be avoided.\n",
